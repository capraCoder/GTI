## Section 1: The Diagnosis

### Game Classification (Based on ACTIONS)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **TRUE Game Type** | **Chicken** |
| **Description** | This is a Chicken game disguised as righteous diplomacy. Austria-Hungary is engaging in brinkmanship - threatening catastrophic war (mutual defection) while hoping the other side will back down. The key signal is 'we cannot back down and look weak' - classic Chicken psychology where prestige/credibility creates commitment to escalation despite catastrophic mutual defection outcomes. |
| **Interaction Type** | Non-Zero-Sum |
| **Symmetry** | Asymmetric |
| **Timing** | Sequential |

### Abstract Payoff Matrix

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **T (Temptation)** | Austria gets prestige, territorial gains, eliminates Serbian threat while others back down |
| **R (Reward)** | Negotiated settlement preserving everyone's core interests |
| **P (Punishment)** | World War - catastrophic for all parties involved |
| **S (Sucker)** | Backing down means loss of Great Power status and credibility |

### Player Analysis: Stated vs Revealed

**Austria-Hungary:**
- **SAYS:** Justice for Archduke's murder > Suppress Serbian nationalism > Maintain Great Power status
- **DOES:** Maintain Great Power credibility above all > Willing to risk catastrophic war rather than appear weak > Eliminate Serbian threat permanently
- **Analysis:** Stated preferences focus on justice and security, but revealed preference is pure prestige/credibility - classic Chicken mentality where 'looking weak' is worse than mutual destruction

**Serbia (with Russian backing):**
- **SAYS:** National sovereignty > Resist foreign intervention > Maintain independence
- **DOES:** Preserve sovereignty even at risk of war > Rely on Russian protection > Cannot accept terms that eliminate independence
- **Analysis:** Also caught in Chicken logic - backing down means effective end of independence

## Section 2: Deception Analysis

### Deception Meter

🎯 **Deception Score: 75%** 🚨 DETECTED

| Classification Method | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| Naive (word-based) | Righteous punishment for terrorism/assassination |
| Structural (action-based) | Prestige-driven brinkmanship where both sides prefer risking catastrophe to backing down |

### Contradiction Signals
- ⚠️ "'We know that Russia may intervene...which would force our ally Germany to mobilize' - acknowledges this leads to world war but proceeds anyway"

### Cheap Talk (Discount These)
- 💨 "Claims about 'justice' and 'suppressing terrorism'"
- 💨 "Framing as defensive necessity"

### Credible Signals (Trust These)
- ✓ "48-hour ultimatum with specific consequences"
- ✓ "'We cannot back down' - credible commitment to escalation"
- ✓ "Acknowledgment of alliance obligations"

### Analysis
Austria frames this as law enforcement against terrorism, but the structure reveals pure Chicken game - they acknowledge this leads to world war but proceed because 'looking weak' is unacceptable. The ultimatum is designed to be unacceptable to force the prestige confrontation.

## Section 3: Evidence

### Verbal Signals (What They SAY)
**Cooperation:** Claims about justice, Suppressing terrorism, Following diplomatic procedures with ultimatum
**Defection:** 'Break diplomatic relations', 'Take necessary measures', 'Cannot back down'

### Action Signals (What They DO) ← Determines Classification
**Cooperation:** Giving 48 hours rather than immediate action, Using diplomatic ultimatum format
**Defection:** Ultimatum designed to be unacceptable, Mobilizing alliances, Creating commitment to escalation

### Confidence
- **Score:** 90%
- **Naive classification:** Justice-seeking punishment game or coordination problem
- **Structural classification:** Chicken game with mutual prestige commitments
- **Divergence:** ⚠️ Yes

---

## Section 4: Prediction

### Nash Equilibrium
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Outcome** | High probability of mutual defection (World War I) |
| **Stability** | Unstable/Volatile |

**Reasoning:** Both players have made credible commitments to not backing down. Alliance system ensures local conflict becomes global catastrophe. Classic Chicken game failure.

### Risk Assessment
- **Level:** Critical
- **Sensitivity:** Failure leads to World War with millions of casualties

---

## Section 5: Prescription

### Mechanism Design
**Lever:** Change **[S - reduce the cost of 'backing down' by providing alternative ways to maintain prestige]**

Face-saving compromise that allows both sides to claim victory while avoiding war

### Advice

| For | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Austria-Hungary** | Find way to achieve core security goals without demanding terms that destroy Serbian sovereignty |
| **Serbia (with Russian backing)** | Offer meaningful concessions that address Austrian security concerns while preserving independence |
| **Mediator** | Create face-saving formula where both sides can claim their core interests were protected |

### 🚨 Victim Warning

**WARNING: All European powers are about to become victims of this prestige-driven brinkmanship. The alliance system will transform a regional dispute into global catastrophe.**
