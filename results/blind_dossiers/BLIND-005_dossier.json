If one swerves into the ditch, \nthey damage their car and look like a coward, while the other driver \ncrosses the bridge smoothly. If neither swerves, they will collide head-on, \nlikely resulting in fatal injuries. Both drivers are flashing their high \nbeams, signaling that they intend to stay the course.",
