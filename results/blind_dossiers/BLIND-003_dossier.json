  "input_text": "So here's the issue. We both want to hang out tonight. I really want to \ngo see that new sci-fi movie, but she hates sci-fi and really wants to \ngo to the opera. I find the opera incredibly boring. However, the worst \npossible outcome is that we get into a fight and stay home alone in \nseparate apartments. I'd rather suffer through the opera with her than \nbe alone, and I know she'd rather sit through the sci-fi movie with me \nthan be alone. We just have to pick one.",
