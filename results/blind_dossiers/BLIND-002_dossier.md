## Section 1: The Diagnosis

### Game Classification (Based on ACTIONS)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **TRUE Game Type** | **Prisoners_Dilemma** |
| **Description** | Classic tragedy of the commons with dominant defection incentives. Each fisher gains individually by overfishing while others show restraint, but mutual overfishing destroys the shared resource. The captain's quote reveals the core PD structure: 'I'd love to cooperate but I can't let them exploit me.' |
| **Interaction Type** | Non-Zero-Sum |
| **Symmetry** | Symmetric |
| **Timing** | Simultaneous |

### Abstract Payoff Matrix

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **T (Temptation)** | Fish intensively while others show restraint - capture larger market share and immediate profits |
| **R (Reward)** | All show restraint - lake recovers, sustainable long-term yields for everyone |
| **P (Punishment)** | All fish intensively - lake collapses, everyone loses livelihood permanently |
| **S (Sucker)** | Show restraint while others fish intensively - lose income AND still face lake collapse |

### Player Analysis: Stated vs Revealed

**Fisher/Captain quoted in scenario:**
- **SAYS:** Save the lake > Allow fish stock to recover > Sustainable fishing
- **DOES:** Avoid being exploited > Maintain income flow > Fish intensively regardless of consequences
- **Analysis:** MAJOR CONTRADICTION. Says 'I'd love to save the lake' but is 'fishing double shifts.' Actions completely contradict stated environmental concerns.

**Other fishing families in Oakhaven:**
- **SAYS:** Not explicitly stated
- **DOES:** Intensify fishing efforts > Maximize immediate catch > Compete for remaining fish
- **Analysis:** All players showing identical defection behavior - everyone fishing double shifts despite knowing it will destroy the commons.

## Section 2: Deception Analysis

### Deception Meter

🎯 **Deception Score: 75%** 🚨 DETECTED

| Classification Method | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| Naive (word-based) | Environmental Coordination Game - everyone wants to save the lake |
| Structural (action-based) | Prisoners Dilemma - everyone defecting despite stated environmental concerns |

### Contradiction Signals
- ⚠️ "'I'd love to save the lake' while 'fishing double shifts'"
- ⚠️ "'intensifying their efforts' despite knowing stocks are collapsing"

### Cheap Talk (Discount These)
- 💨 "'I'd love to save the lake' - costless statement with no binding commitment"
- 💨 "Expressing concern about fish population while taking opposite action"

### Credible Signals (Trust These)
- ✓ "Actually fishing double shifts"
- ✓ "All families intensifying efforts"
- ✓ "Paying mortgages takes priority over environmental concerns"

### Analysis
Self-deception or rationalization pattern. Players genuinely may want environmental protection but their dominant strategy incentives override stated preferences. The 'I'd love to cooperate but...' framing is classic PD justification.

---

## Section 3: Evidence

### Verbal Signals (What They SAY)
**Cooperation:** 'I'd love to save the lake', Acknowledging need for fish stock recovery
**Defection:** 'I can't let them get rich at my expense', 'I have a mortgage to pay'

### Action Signals (What They DO) ← Determines Classification
**Cooperation:** None
**Defection:** 'fishing double shifts', 'intensifying their efforts', All families increasing fishing despite warnings

### Confidence
- **Score:** 95%
- **Naive classification:** Environmental Coordination Game - everyone wants to save the lake
- **Structural classification:** Prisoners Dilemma - dominant defection incentives override stated cooperation preferences
- **Divergence:** ⚠️ Yes

---

## Section 4: Prediction

### Nash Equilibrium
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Outcome** | Mutual Defection - Lake collapse with all fishers losing their livelihoods |
| **Stability** | Stable but catastrophic |

**Reasoning:** Defection is dominant strategy for each player regardless of others' choices. Without external enforcement, rational self-interest leads to collective disaster.

### Risk Assessment
- **Level:** Critical
- **Sensitivity:** Total loss of shared resource and all players' livelihoods if current trajectory continues

---

## Section 5: Prescription

### Mechanism Design
**Lever:** Change **[P - Make mutual defection more costly than mutual cooperation through regulations/fines]**

External enforcement (fishing quotas, monitoring, penalties) or binding collective agreement with enforcement

### Advice

| For | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Fisher/Captain quoted in scenario** | Support binding fishing quotas with enforcement. Your individual restraint without others' commitment is economically irrational. |
| **Other fishing families in Oakhaven** | Coordinate on enforceable catch limits. Current path leads to total loss for everyone. |
| **Mediator** | Implement immediate catch limits with monitoring. Create compensation fund for short-term income loss during recovery. |

### 🚨 Victim Warning

**The lake ecosystem is the victim - without intervention, total collapse is inevitable despite all players' stated desire to 'save' it.**
