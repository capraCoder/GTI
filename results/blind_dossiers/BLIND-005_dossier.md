## Section 1: The Diagnosis

### Game Classification (Based on ACTIONS)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **TRUE Game Type** | **Chicken** |
| **Description** | This is a pure Chicken game where mutual defection (continuing straight) leads to catastrophic outcomes for both players, while unilateral cooperation (swerving) creates asymmetric payoffs favoring the defector |
| **Interaction Type** | Non-Zero-Sum |
| **Symmetry** | Symmetric |
| **Timing** | Simultaneous |

### Abstract Payoff Matrix

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **T (Temptation)** | Cross bridge smoothly while opponent damages car and reputation |
| **R (Reward)** | No clear mutual cooperation outcome - bridge admits only one |
| **P (Punishment)** | Fatal collision - catastrophic loss for both |
| **S (Sucker)** | Damaged car, financial cost, social humiliation as 'coward' |

### Player Analysis: Stated vs Revealed

**Driver approaching from one direction:**
- **SAYS:** Cross bridge without yielding
- **DOES:** Cross bridge without yielding > Avoid fatal collision
- **Analysis:** Stated and revealed preferences align - driver is committed to aggressive strategy while using high beams as credible threat signal

**Driver approaching from opposite direction:**
- **SAYS:** Cross bridge without yielding
- **DOES:** Cross bridge without yielding > Avoid fatal collision
- **Analysis:** Mirror situation to Player A - both using identical threat signaling

## Section 2: Deception Analysis

### Deception Meter

🎯 **Deception Score: 15%** ✓ Clear

| Classification Method | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| Naive (word-based) | Chicken game with mutual commitment to aggression |
| Structural (action-based) | Chicken game with mutual commitment to aggression |

### Contradiction Signals
- (None detected)

### Cheap Talk (Discount These)
- (None detected)

### Credible Signals (Trust These)
- ✓ "Maintaining speed toward bridge"
- ✓ "Flashing high beams as commitment signal"
- ✓ "Neither driver slowing down"

### Analysis
No deception detected - both players are honestly signaling aggressive intentions through costly commitment (not slowing down). High beam flashing serves as credible threat communication.

---

## Section 3: Evidence

### Verbal Signals (What They SAY)
**Cooperation:** None
**Defection:** None

### Action Signals (What They DO) ← Determines Classification
**Cooperation:** None
**Defection:** Speeding toward bridge, Not slowing down, Flashing high beams as threat signal, Neither yielding right of way

### Confidence
- **Score:** 95%
- **Naive classification:** Chicken game
- **Structural classification:** Chicken game
- **Divergence:** No

## Section 4: Prediction

### Nash Equilibrium
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Outcome** | Extremely dangerous - heading toward mutual defection (collision) unless one player blinks |
| **Stability** | Unstable/Volatile |

**Reasoning:** Classic Chicken instability - both players committed to aggressive strategy leading toward worst possible outcome. Game will resolve when one player's nerve breaks or collision occurs.

### Risk Assessment
- **Level:** Critical
- **Sensitivity:** Fatal consequences if neither yields. Immediate life-or-death situation.

---

## Section 5: Prescription

### Mechanism Design
**Lever:** Change **[P - need to make mutual defection less catastrophic through safety infrastructure, or change S to reduce humiliation of yielding]**

Traffic infrastructure (traffic lights, clear right-of-way rules) or communication systems to coordinate before commitment phase

### Advice

| For | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Driver approaching from one direction** | IMMEDIATE: Assess opponent's commitment level and your own survival value. If opponent appears equally committed, yield immediately. Pride is not worth death. |
| **Driver approaching from opposite direction** | IMMEDIATE: Same as Player A. This is not about winning but surviving. |
| **Mediator** | Install traffic infrastructure to prevent such encounters - traffic lights, alternating right-of-way systems, or separate lanes/timing |

### 🚨 Victim Warning

**CRITICAL: Both players are potential victims of fatal collision if neither yields immediately. This requires instant decision-making prioritizing survival over pride.**
