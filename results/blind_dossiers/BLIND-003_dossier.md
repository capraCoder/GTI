## Section 1: The Diagnosis

### Game Classification (Based on ACTIONS)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **TRUE Game Type** | **Battle_of_the_Sexes** |
| **Description** | Classic coordination game with conflicting preferences. Both players want to coordinate (be together) but prefer different activities. The payoff structure shows R1≠R2 (different coordination preferences) and mutual defection (staying apart) is worst for both. |
| **Interaction Type** | Non-Zero-Sum |
| **Symmetry** | Symmetric in structure, Asymmetric in preferences |
| **Timing** | Simultaneous |

### Abstract Payoff Matrix

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **T (Temptation)** | Getting your preferred activity with partner (highest individual payoff) |
| **R (Reward)** | Compromise - going to partner's preferred activity together |
| **P (Punishment)** | Both staying home alone (mutual defection) |
| **S (Sucker)** | Same as R in this game - compromising is still better than being alone |

### Player Analysis: Stated vs Revealed

**Person who wants to see sci-fi movie:**
- **SAYS:** Go to sci-fi movie together > Go to opera together > Stay home alone
- **DOES:** Go to sci-fi movie together > Go to opera together > Stay home alone
- **Analysis:** Stated and revealed preferences align perfectly. Genuine expression of preferences with clear ranking.

**Person who wants to go to opera:**
- **SAYS:** Go to opera together > Go to sci-fi movie together > Stay home alone
- **DOES:** Go to opera together > Go to sci-fi movie together > Stay home alone
- **Analysis:** Consistent preference revelation. Also values being together over being alone.

## Section 2: Deception Analysis

### Deception Meter

🎯 **Deception Score: 5%** ✓ Clear

| Classification Method | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| Naive (word-based) | Battle of the Sexes coordination problem |
| Structural (action-based) | Battle of the Sexes coordination problem |

### Contradiction Signals
- (None detected)

### Cheap Talk (Discount These)
- (None detected)

### Credible Signals (Trust These)
- ✓ "Both explicitly state preference for compromise over separation"
- ✓ "Clear admission of dislike for partner's preference shows honesty"

### Analysis
No deception detected. This is a straightforward coordination problem with honest preference revelation. Both players are transparent about their rankings.

---

## Section 3: Evidence

### Verbal Signals (What They SAY)
**Cooperation:** 'We both want to hang out tonight', 'I'd rather suffer through the opera with her than be alone', 'she'd rather sit through the sci-fi movie with me than be alone'
**Defection:** 'I find the opera incredibly boring', 'she hates sci-fi'

### Action Signals (What They DO) ← Determines Classification
**Cooperation:** Willingness to compromise on activity choice, Mutual desire to spend time together
**Defection:** None

### Confidence
- **Score:** 95%
- **Naive classification:** Battle of the Sexes
- **Structural classification:** Battle of the Sexes
- **Divergence:** No

## Section 4: Prediction

### Nash Equilibrium
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Outcome** | Either (Sci-fi, Sci-fi) or (Opera, Opera) - two pure strategy Nash equilibria |
| **Stability** | Stable once chosen, but selection problem exists |

**Reasoning:** Both coordination equilibria are stable, but players need a mechanism to select which one. Mixed strategy equilibrium exists but yields lower expected payoffs.

### Risk Assessment
- **Level:** Moderate
- **Sensitivity:** Risk of coordination failure leading to mutual defection (staying apart)

---

## Section 5: Prescription

### Mechanism Design
**Lever:** Change **[R - increase rewards for coordination through pre-commitment or turn-taking]**

Implement coordination mechanism: alternating choice, side payments, or focal point selection

### Advice

| For | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Person who wants to see sci-fi movie** | Propose alternating system: 'You pick tonight, I pick next time' or offer side payment |
| **Person who wants to go to opera** | Same - suggest fair rotation system or bundle deal across multiple interactions |
| **Mediator** | Suggest coin flip, alternating system, or help identify natural focal points |

### 🚨 Victim Warning

**No victim detected - this is mutual coordination problem, not exploitation**
