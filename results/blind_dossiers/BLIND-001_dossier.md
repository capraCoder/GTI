## Section 1: The Diagnosis

### Game Classification (Based on ACTIONS)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **TRUE Game Type** | **Prisoners_Dilemma** |
| **Description** | Classic PD structure where mutual cooperation (raising prices) benefits both, but unilateral defection (keeping prices low while competitor raises) creates massive advantage. Both trapped in mutually destructive equilibrium. |
| **Interaction Type** | Non-Zero-Sum |
| **Symmetry** | Symmetric |
| **Timing** | Simultaneous |

### Abstract Payoff Matrix

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **T (Temptation)** | 90% market share if you keep prices low while competitor raises |
| **R (Reward)** | Both return to standard market rates with normal profit margins |
| **P (Punishment)** | Both stuck at rock-bottom prices with 40% revenue loss |
| **S (Sucker)** | Lose 90% of customers if you raise prices while competitor stays low |

### Player Analysis: Stated vs Revealed

**Speaking company in price war:**
- **SAYS:** Stop the price war > Return to standard market rates > End mutual destruction
- **DOES:** Avoid being the sucker who raises first > Maintain market share > Don't lose 90% of customers
- **Analysis:** Stated and revealed preferences align - genuine desire to escape PD trap but rational fear of unilateral cooperation

**Competitor X:**
- **SAYS:** Unknown - no direct quotes
- **DOES:** Match every price cut > Maintain competitive position > Don't let competitor gain advantage
- **Analysis:** Actions show identical strategic position - trapped in same PD structure

## Section 2: Deception Analysis

### Deception Meter

🎯 **Deception Score: 15%** ✓ Clear

| Classification Method | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| Naive (word-based) | Prisoners_Dilemma with mutual recognition of trap |
| Structural (action-based) | Prisoners_Dilemma with mutual recognition of trap |

### Contradiction Signals
- (None detected)

### Cheap Talk (Discount These)
- 💨 "'Ideally we'd both raise prices' - costless statement of preference"

### Credible Signals (Trust These)
- ✓ "Actual price matching behavior"
- ✓ "Continued participation in price war despite losses"

### Analysis
No deception detected. Speaker honestly acknowledges the structural trap and legal constraints preventing coordination.

---

## Section 3: Evidence

### Verbal Signals (What They SAY)
**Cooperation:** 'Ideally, we'd both just raise our prices back to the standard market rate'
**Defection:** None

### Action Signals (What They DO) ← Determines Classification
**Cooperation:** None
**Defection:** Every time we drop our subscription fee by $5, they match it, Both keeping prices at rock bottom

### Confidence
- **Score:** 95%
- **Naive classification:** Prisoners_Dilemma
- **Structural classification:** Prisoners_Dilemma
- **Divergence:** No

## Section 4: Prediction

### Nash Equilibrium
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Outcome** | Continued mutual defection (low prices) despite both preferring cooperation |
| **Stability** | Stable |

**Reasoning:** Nash equilibrium at mutual defection. Neither player can unilaterally improve by raising prices due to massive customer loss risk.

### Risk Assessment
- **Level:** Critical
- **Sensitivity:** Continued value destruction for both companies until one exits market or finds alternative solution

---

## Section 5: Prescription

### Mechanism Design
**Lever:** Change **[T - Reduce temptation payoff through differentiation or increase switching costs]**

Price leadership, market segmentation, or regulatory intervention to enable coordination

### Advice

| For | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Speaking company in price war** | Differentiate product to reduce price sensitivity, build switching costs, or seek non-price competitive advantages |
| **Competitor X** | Same strategic advice - escape pure price competition through differentiation |
| **Mediator** | Industry association could facilitate non-collusive coordination mechanisms or government could modify antitrust interpretation |

### 🚨 Victim Warning

**No victim - both players trapped in mutually destructive equilibrium**
