## Section 1: The Diagnosis

### Game Classification (Based on ACTIONS)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **TRUE Game Type** | **Prisoners_Dilemma** |
| **Description** | Classic Prisoner's Dilemma structure where T=0 > R=1 > P=5 > S=10. Each prisoner has a dominant strategy to defect (testify) regardless of partner's choice, but mutual cooperation (silence) would yield better collective outcome. |
| **Interaction Type** | Non-Zero-Sum |
| **Symmetry** | Symmetric |
| **Timing** | Simultaneous |

### Abstract Payoff Matrix

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **T (Temptation)** | 0 years jail (walk free while partner gets 10 years) |
| **R (Reward)** | 1 year jail each (both stay silent on major charge) |
| **P (Punishment)** | 5 years jail each (both testify, deal nullified) |
| **S (Sucker)** | 10 years jail (stay silent while partner testifies) |

### Player Analysis: Stated vs Revealed

**Red Hand gang member #1:**
- **SAYS:** Gang loyalty would suggest: stay silent, protect partner
- **DOES:** Self-preservation: minimize own jail time regardless of partner
- **Analysis:** Despite any gang loyalty rhetoric, facing 10 vs 0 years creates overwhelming incentive to defect

**Red Hand gang member #2:**
- **SAYS:** Gang loyalty would suggest: stay silent, protect partner
- **DOES:** Self-preservation: minimize own jail time regardless of partner
- **Analysis:** Identical incentive structure to Player A - loyalty rhetoric cannot overcome dominant strategy

## Section 2: Deception Analysis

### Deception Meter

🎯 **Deception Score: 15%** ✓ Clear

| Classification Method | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| Naive (word-based) | Gang loyalty coordination game where silence is expected |
| Structural (action-based) | Prisoner's Dilemma where defection dominates despite loyalty norms |

### Contradiction Signals
- ⚠️ "Gang members may claim loyalty but face overwhelming defection incentives"

### Cheap Talk (Discount These)
- 💨 "Any pre-arrest promises of loyalty are now costless"

### Credible Signals (Trust These)
- ✓ "The legal consequences are binding and credible"

### Analysis
No active deception by players - the dilemma structure itself creates the tragedy

---

## Section 3: Evidence

### Verbal Signals (What They SAY)
**Cooperation:** Implicit gang code of silence, Honor among thieves mythology
**Defection:** No explicit defection statements - this is about revealed preferences

### Action Signals (What They DO) ← Determines Classification
**Cooperation:** Staying silent despite personal cost
**Defection:** Testifying to secure personal freedom

### Confidence
- **Score:** 95%
- **Naive classification:** Gang loyalty coordination game
- **Structural classification:** Prisoner's Dilemma with defection dominance
- **Divergence:** ⚠️ Yes

---

## Section 4: Prediction

### Nash Equilibrium
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Outcome** | Both testify, both get 5 years (Nash equilibrium) |
| **Stability** | Stable |

**Reasoning:** Testifying is dominant strategy for both players. Even with perfect gang loyalty beliefs, rational players must testify to avoid 10-year sucker payoff

### Risk Assessment
- **Level:** Critical
- **Sensitivity:** Individual faces 10-year maximum exposure if they trust partner loyalty

---

## Section 5: Prescription

### Mechanism Design
**Lever:** Change **[T - reduce the temptation payoff (perhaps no immunity, just reduced sentence)]**

Change the payoff structure - reduce T (temptation) or increase R (cooperation reward) relative to P and S

### Advice

| For | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Red Hand gang member #1** | Rationally you must testify - the 10-year risk is too catastrophic to gamble on partner loyalty |
| **Red Hand gang member #2** | Identical situation - testify to avoid worst-case 10-year outcome |
| **Mediator** | This is why plea bargaining creates prisoner's dilemmas - consider reforming incentive structure |

### 🚨 Victim Warning

**Any gang member believing in 'honor among thieves' faces potential 10-year betrayal - loyalty rhetoric cannot overcome these incentives**
