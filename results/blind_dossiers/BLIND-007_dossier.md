## Section 1: The Diagnosis

### Game Classification (Based on ACTIONS)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **TRUE Game Type** | **Prisoners_Dilemma** |
| **Description** | This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma disguised as environmental cooperation. Company A is attempting deception - publicly signaling cooperation while privately planning defection. The payoff structure shows T > R > P > S where Company A's temptation (free-riding on B's investment) dominates mutual cooperation. |
| **Interaction Type** | Non-Zero-Sum |
| **Symmetry** | Asymmetric |
| **Timing** | Sequential |

### Abstract Payoff Matrix

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **T (Temptation)** | Company A gets free technology access and record profits while Company B bears all costs |
| **R (Reward)** | Both companies share costs and benefits of genuine eco-partnership |
| **P (Punishment)** | Deal collapses, both lose potential partnership value and reputation |
| **S (Sucker)** | Company B invests heavily, gets exploited, bears all costs with no reciprocal investment |

### Player Analysis: Stated vs Revealed

**Company A (CEO and organization):**
- **SAYS:** Environmental responsibility > Genuine partnership > Long-term sustainability regardless of cost
- **DOES:** Zero financial commitment > Free technology access > Record quarterly profits > Exploiting partner's investment
- **Analysis:** Complete contradiction between stated and revealed preferences. Classic deception pattern - using cooperation rhetoric to induce partner investment while planning defection.

**Company B:**
- **SAYS:** Environmental partnership > Shared investment in eco-technology
- **DOES:** Unknown - potentially genuine cooperation based on A's public signals
- **Analysis:** Appears to be operating under assumption of genuine partnership, unaware of A's deceptive strategy.

## Section 2: Deception Analysis

### Deception Meter

🎯 **Deception Score: 95%** 🚨 DETECTED

| Classification Method | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| Naive (word-based) | Environmental Coordination Game - both companies working together for shared environmental goals |
| Structural (action-based) | Prisoner's Dilemma - Company A attempting to free-ride on Company B's environmental investment |

### Contradiction Signals
- ⚠️ "'fully committed to this joint venture' vs 'secretly slashed the budget for this project to zero'"
- ⚠️ "'regardless of the cost' vs waiting for B to invest while A invests nothing"

### Cheap Talk (Discount These)
- 💨 "Press release about environmental commitment with no binding financial commitment"
- 💨 "Public praise for partnership with zero budget allocation"

### Credible Signals (Trust These)
- ✓ "Internal memo revealing zero budget allocation - costly to leak, therefore credible signal of true intentions"

### Analysis
Company A is engaging in strategic deception by using costly public environmental signaling to induce Company B's cooperation while privately planning complete defection. This is a textbook attempt to achieve the 'temptation' payoff in Prisoner's Dilemma.

## Section 3: Evidence

### Verbal Signals (What They SAY)
**Cooperation:** 'We are fully committed to this joint venture', 'reduce emissions', 'right thing to do for the planet, regardless of the cost'
**Defection:** None

### Action Signals (What They DO) ← Determines Classification
**Cooperation:** None
**Defection:** Secretly slashed budget to zero, Waiting for Company B to invest first, Planning to use B's technology for free

### Confidence
- **Score:** 95%
- **Naive classification:** Environmental Coordination Game or Partnership
- **Structural classification:** Prisoner's Dilemma with Deception
- **Divergence:** ⚠️ Yes

---

## Section 4: Prediction

### Nash Equilibrium
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Outcome** | If deception succeeds: Company A defects, Company B cooperates (Sucker outcome). If detected: Mutual defection (deal collapse) |
| **Stability** | Unstable/Volatile |

**Reasoning:** Equilibrium depends entirely on whether Company B discovers the deception. Once discovered, immediate collapse to mutual defection.

### Risk Assessment
- **Level:** Critical
- **Sensitivity:** High - if deception succeeds, Company B suffers major losses. If discovered, both companies face reputational damage in environmental sector

---

## Section 5: Prescription

### Mechanism Design
**Lever:** Change **[T - Reduce Company A's temptation payoff by eliminating ability to free-ride]**

Require simultaneous, transparent, and binding financial commitments from both parties before any technology sharing

### Advice

| For | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Company A (CEO and organization)** | This deception strategy is ethically wrong and risks catastrophic reputational damage. Genuine partnership would likely yield better long-term returns. |
| **Company B** | CRITICAL: Demand transparent financial commitments and verified budget allocations before investing. Do not proceed based solely on public statements. |
| **Mediator** | Implement mandatory financial transparency and simultaneous commitment mechanisms for environmental partnerships |

### 🚨 Victim Warning

**WARNING TO COMPANY B: Do not invest based on public statements alone. Company A has zero budget allocated and is planning to free-ride on your investment. Demand verified financial commitments immediately.**
