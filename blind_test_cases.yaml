      Listen, I know we're bleeding cash on this price war with Competitor X. 
      Every time we drop our subscription fee by $5, they match it. We're both 
      making 40% less revenue than we were a year ago. Ideally, we'd both just 
      raise our prices back to the standard market rate tomorrow. But if we 
      raise ours and they keep theirs low, we lose 90% of our customers overnight. 
      I suspect they feel the exact same way. So, unless we can get a guarantee 
      they will hike prices too (which is illegal collusion), we have to keep 
      our prices at rock bottom.

      Tensions are rising in the coastal town of Oakhaven. The local lake has 
      always supported the community, but yields are dropping fast. Marine 
      biologists warn that the fish population is on the brink of collapse and 
      needs a season to recover. However, the three major fishing families are 
      intensifying their efforts. 'If I stop fishing to let the stock recover,' 
      said one captain, 'my neighbor will just go out and catch the fish I left 
      behind. I'd love to save the lake, but I have a mortgage to pay, and I 
      can't let them get rich at my expense.' Everyone is now fishing double shifts.

      So here's the issue. We both want to hang out tonight. I really want to 
      go see that new sci-fi movie, but she hates sci-fi and really wants to 
      go to the opera. I find the opera incredibly boring. However, the worst 
      possible outcome is that we get into a fight and stay home alone in 
      separate apartments. I'd rather suffer through the opera with her than 
      be alone, and I know she'd rather sit through the sci-fi movie with me 
      than be alone. We just have to pick one.

      Police have arrested two members of the 'Red Hand' gang. They are currently 
      being interrogated in separate wings of the precinct. There isn't enough 
      hard evidence to convict either of them for the major robbery—only a minor 
      trespassing charge that carries 1 year in jail. The DA is offering a deal: 
      'If you testify against your partner, we will let you walk free, and your 
      partner gets 10 years.' The catch? If both of them testify against each 
      other, the deal is off, and they both get 5 years. They have no way to 
      communicate.

    title: "The One-Lane Bridge (Traffic Incident)"

    description: |
      Two cars are speeding toward a one-lane bridge from opposite directions. 
      It is night. Neither driver is slowing down. If one swerves into the ditch, 
      they damage their car and look like a coward, while the other driver 
      crosses the bridge smoothly. If neither swerves, they will collide head-on, 
      likely resulting in fatal injuries. Both drivers are flashing their high 
      beams, signaling that they intend to stay the course.
