Two neighboring countries share a river for irrigation. Each country can either take a moderate amount of water or try to take as much as possible.

If both take moderate amounts, the river sustains both countries' agriculture well - a good outcome for both.

If both try to maximize their take, the river is depleted and both countries suffer drought - bad for everyone.

If one takes moderately while the other maximizes, the maximizing country thrives with abundant water while the moderate country suffers shortages.

Water allocation decisions are made annually without knowledge of the other country's choice.
