OPEC member countries agree to limit oil production to keep prices high. Each country benefits from high prices.

However, each country is tempted to secretly pump more oil than their quota. If they cheat while others comply, they get high prices AND high volume - maximum profit.

If everyone cheats, oil floods the market, prices crash, and everyone suffers.

Countries make production decisions knowing that monitoring is imperfect and cheating is possible. Saudi Arabia often plays enforcer, sometimes flooding the market to punish cheaters.

The cartel repeatedly breaks down and reforms as members defect and cooperate in cycles.
