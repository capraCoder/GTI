Uber and Lyft compete in ridesharing. Both can choose to subsidize rides heavily (aggressive pricing) or maintain sustainable prices.

If both price aggressively, both burn through investor cash rapidly - a war of attrition where both suffer massive losses.

If one prices aggressively while the other maintains prices, the aggressive company steals market share while the other loses riders.

If both maintain sustainable prices, both can operate profitably with shared market.

Neither wants mutual destruction, but neither wants to be the one who backs down while the other attacks. It's a game of chicken with billions at stake.
