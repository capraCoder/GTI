Advertising War

Two competing smartphone companies, TechCorp and MobileInc, must decide their advertising strategy for the upcoming holiday season. Each company can either:
- Maintain their current modest advertising budget (Cooperate)
- Launch an aggressive advertising campaign (Defect)

If both maintain modest budgets, they split the market evenly and keep costs low - both profit well.

If both launch aggressive campaigns, they still split the market but waste money on competing ads - both profit less.

If one company advertises aggressively while the other stays modest, the aggressive advertiser captures most of the market and profits greatly, while the modest company loses market share and profits poorly.

Both companies must commit to their advertising budgets simultaneously before the season begins, without knowing the other's choice.

This is a one-time decision for this holiday season.
