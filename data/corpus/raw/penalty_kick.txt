A goalie and a penalty kicker face off. The kicker can aim left or right. The goalie must dive left or right at the same moment the ball is kicked.

If the goalie dives the same direction the kicker shoots, the goalie saves it and the kicker fails.

If the goalie dives the opposite direction, the kicker scores and wins.

Neither can see what the other chooses until it's too late to change. The kicker wants to score, the goalie wants to save - pure opposition.
