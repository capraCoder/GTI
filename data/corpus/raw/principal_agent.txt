A factory owner hires a manager to run operations. The owner can either monitor the manager closely (expensive) or trust them to work unsupervised.

The manager can either work hard (costly effort) or slack off (easy but lower output).

If monitored and working hard: good output, owner pays monitoring cost, manager gets paid but effort is tiring.

If monitored and slacking: manager gets caught and fired, owner wasted monitoring cost.

If unmonitored and working hard: good output, no monitoring cost, but manager bears effort cost voluntarily.

If unmonitored and slacking: low output, manager has easy life, owner loses money.

The owner sets the monitoring policy, then the manager decides effort level without the owner observing directly.
