Pepsi and Coca-Cola both spend billions on advertising each year. If both stopped advertising, they would split the market roughly equally and save the advertising costs.

However, if one advertises while the other doesn't, the advertiser gains significant market share. So both advertise heavily, spending money that largely cancels out.

Both companies choose their advertising budgets simultaneously each quarter without knowing the other's decision. Both would be better off if they could credibly commit to reduce advertising, but neither can trust the other to follow through.

The result: both spend heavily on ads, profits are lower than they could be, but neither dares stop first.
