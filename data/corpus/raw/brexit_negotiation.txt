UK voted to leave EU. Negotiations over exit terms began.

EU made initial offers on trade terms, citizens' rights, and the Irish border.

UK could accept offers, reject and counter-propose, or walk away with no deal.

EU held most leverage: UK needed trade access more than EU needed UK market. But no-deal would hurt both.

The "backstop" became a blocking issue - neither side could accept the other's proposal on the Irish border.

Multiple UK governments rejected deals. Parliament rejected deals. Extensions granted.

Eventually a modified deal passed, but only after the credible threat of no-deal became imminent.
