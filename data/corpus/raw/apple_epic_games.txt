Epic Games makes Fortnite. Apple runs the App Store with 30% commission on all purchases.

Epic added direct payment option bypassing Apple's cut. Apple removed Fortnite from App Store.

Epic sued, claiming Apple's commission is monopolistic. Apple claimed Epic violated contract terms.

Epic wanted to change the rules while continuing to benefit from Apple's platform and users.

Apple wanted to maintain control and revenue share that funds App Store operations.

Both had leverage: Apple controls access to iPhone users. Epic controls a game with millions of players.

Court ruled mostly for Apple on contract, but forced some App Store changes.

Principal (Apple) vs Agent (Epic) conflict over how much of the value each party captures.
