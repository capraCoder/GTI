eBay: Buyers and sellers who will never meet in person must trust each other.

Seller could ship fake goods. Buyer could claim non-delivery and get refund.

One-shot game: Strong temptation to cheat.

eBay solution: Reputation scores. Every transaction rated. History visible to all.

Sellers with good ratings get more sales and can charge higher prices.
Cheating once destroys reputation built over hundreds of transactions.

Buyers check ratings before purchasing. Low-rated sellers struggle to sell.

Repeated game structure transforms incentives: Long-term reputation value exceeds one-time cheating gain.

Trust emerges from mechanism design, not inherent honesty.
