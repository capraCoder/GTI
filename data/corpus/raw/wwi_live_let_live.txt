WWI trenches: Opposing soldiers faced each other for months. Each day, both sides could shell the enemy or hold fire.

One-shot logic says always attack. But soldiers would face the same enemy tomorrow.

Informal truces emerged: Don't shell during meals. Aim to miss. Establish patterns.

If one side broke the truce, the other would retaliate massively, then return to cooperation if the first side stopped.

Officers rotated troops specifically to break these cooperative equilibria.

A repeated game where cooperation emerged despite official orders to fight, sustained by the threat of retaliation.
