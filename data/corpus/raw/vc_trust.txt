A venture capitalist is considering investing $100,000 in a startup. If she invests, the money triples to $300,000 due to the startup's growth potential.

The startup founder then decides how much to return to the investor. He could return half ($150,000 each), return nothing and keep it all, or anything in between.

If the VC doesn't invest, both parties keep their original positions - the VC keeps her money, and the founder has to seek funding elsewhere.

The VC must decide first whether to send the money, knowing the founder will decide afterward how much to return.
