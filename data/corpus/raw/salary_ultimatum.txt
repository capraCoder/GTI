In a salary negotiation, the employer makes the first offer to a job candidate.

The employer can offer a fair salary of $80,000 (splitting the surplus value the employee would create) or a low-ball offer of $50,000.

The candidate can then accept whatever is offered, or reject and walk away, in which case neither party gets anything - the position stays unfilled and the candidate continues job searching.

The employer moves first with the offer, then the candidate responds.
