Two hunters in the wilderness must decide whether to hunt a stag or hunt rabbits.

Hunting a stag requires both hunters to cooperate - if both hunt stag together, they catch it and both get a large feast.

However, if one hunter goes for the stag while the other hunts rabbits, the stag hunter fails and gets nothing, while the rabbit hunter catches some small game.

If both hunt rabbits independently, they each catch enough to eat but miss the opportunity for the larger prize.

They cannot communicate once they separate in the forest and must choose their strategy beforehand.
