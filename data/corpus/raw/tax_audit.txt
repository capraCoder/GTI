A tax authority must decide whether to audit a business. The business simultaneously decides whether to report income honestly or underreport.

If the business is honest and gets audited, the business pays normal taxes plus wastes time on the audit, while the authority wastes audit resources on a compliant taxpayer.

If the business is honest and not audited, both are satisfied - taxes paid, no waste.

If the business cheats and gets audited, the business pays heavy penalties and the authority collects extra revenue.

If the business cheats and isn't audited, the business keeps the evaded taxes and the authority loses revenue without knowing.

Both decide simultaneously.
