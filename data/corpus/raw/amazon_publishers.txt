Amazon dominated ebook sales with Kindle. Publishers supplied books, Amazon set retail prices.

Amazon priced bestsellers at $9.99, often below wholesale cost, to drive Kindle adoption.

Publishers feared $9.99 would become the expected price for all books, destroying margins.

Apple offered publishers "agency model" - publishers set prices, Apple takes 30%.

Publishers coordinated to demand Amazon accept agency model. Amazon initially refused.

Publishers threatened to withhold new releases. Amazon removed "buy" buttons from publisher catalogs.

Standoff resolved with publishers getting some price control but under antitrust scrutiny.

Ultimatum structure: Publishers make demand, Amazon accepts or both lose sales.
