Delta dominates the Atlanta hub. Southwest considers entering with direct flights.

If Southwest enters, Delta can accommodate (maintain current prices, accept reduced share) or fight (slash prices dramatically to make Southwest's routes unprofitable).

Fighting hurts Delta's profits too, but might deter future entrants. Southwest knows that Delta has fought entrants before and has deep pockets.

Southwest moves first by announcing routes. Delta then responds with its pricing strategy.

Southwest must judge whether Delta's threat to fight is credible or a bluff.
