Star player enters free agency. Multiple teams want to sign them.

Each team can bid aggressively (offer max contract) or stay disciplined (offer fair value).

If multiple teams bid max: Price goes above player's value, winner overpays.
If one team bids max alone: Gets the player at high but not insane price.
If all stay disciplined: Player signs for reasonable money.

Teams don't know others' true valuations or budget constraints.

Often: Teams bid against themselves, assuming competition that doesn't exist.
Sometimes: Teams tacitly coordinate to suppress prices (collusion, often illegal).

The "winner's curse" - the team that values the player most may be the most wrong about their value.
