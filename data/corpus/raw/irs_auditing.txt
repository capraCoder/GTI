IRS has limited audit resources. Taxpayers choose whether to report honestly.

If taxpayer honest + audited: Taxpayer compliant, IRS wasted audit cost.
If taxpayer honest + not audited: Optimal outcome for both.
If taxpayer cheats + audited: Taxpayer caught, pays penalties. IRS recovers revenue.
If taxpayer cheats + not audited: Taxpayer gains from evasion, IRS loses.

IRS can't audit everyone. Taxpayers know this.

Equilibrium: IRS audits randomly at rate that makes taxpayers indifferent between cheating and honesty.
Taxpayers cheat at rate that makes IRS indifferent between auditing and not.

Real IRS uses risk scoring to audit "suspicious" returns more often - changes the game by making cheating harder to hide.
