2023: United Auto Workers demanded major wage increases from Ford, GM, and Stellantis.

Strategy: "Stand Up Strike" - strike at selected plants, expand if no progress.

Companies could offer generous terms (high cost but end strike) or hold firm (risk extended shutdown).

Union could accept offers or escalate (shut more plants, extend pain for both sides).

If both hold firm too long: Plants idle for months, billions lost, workers without paychecks.

Union president made public demands. Companies made counter-offers. Each side watched the other's moves.

Strikes expanded incrementally. Eventually all three companies settled with record contracts.

The ability to expand strikes gradually let union calibrate pressure without all-or-nothing gamble.
