1970s-80s: Two incompatible video formats compete. VHS (JVC) vs Betamax (Sony).

Consumers want to buy the format that will have the most content available.
Studios want to release on the format with the most players installed.

If everyone coordinates on VHS: VHS wins, everyone benefits from compatibility.
If everyone coordinates on Betamax: Betamax wins, everyone benefits.
If market splits: Both formats struggle, consumers stuck with limited content.

Technical quality favored Betamax. But VHS got early content deals and longer recording times.

Once VHS pulled slightly ahead, network effects amplified the lead. Betamax died despite being "better."

Classic coordination game where early momentum determined the outcome.
