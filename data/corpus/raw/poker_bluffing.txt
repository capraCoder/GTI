Texas Hold'em: Two players, one pot.

Each player knows their own cards but not opponent's.

Options: Bet/raise (aggressive) or check/fold (passive).

Bluffing: Betting strong with weak cards to make opponent fold.
Value betting: Betting strong with strong cards to get called.

If you never bluff: Opponent folds whenever you bet, you win small pots only.
If you always bluff: Opponent always calls, your bluffs lose.

Optimal strategy: Randomize. Bluff some percentage that makes opponent indifferent between calling and folding.

This is a zero-sum game with incomplete information. Pure strategies are exploitable. Mixed strategies required.

The math determines optimal bluff frequency based on pot odds.
