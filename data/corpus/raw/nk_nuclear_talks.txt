North Korea wants security guarantees and sanctions relief. USA wants denuclearization.

Problem: Any deal requires sequential moves. If NK disarms first, USA might not deliver benefits. If USA lifts sanctions first, NK might not disarm.

Neither side can credibly commit to their part of a deal. Past agreements have broken down when one side felt cheated.

NK's nuclear weapons are its only leverage - giving them up first means trusting an adversary completely.

Both sides prefer a deal to no deal, but neither can solve the commitment problem.

Attempts at partial, staged agreements have repeatedly failed when trust breaks down mid-sequence.
