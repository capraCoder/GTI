Open source projects like Linux rely on volunteers contributing code.

Contributors spend time improving software they could use for free anyway.

If everyone free-rides: No contributions, project dies.
If some contribute: Contributors bear costs, everyone benefits.

Why do people contribute?
- Reputation (visible commits signal skill)
- Reciprocity (use others' code, contribute back)
- Intrinsic motivation (enjoy the work)
- Corporate backing (companies pay developers to contribute)

The "tragedy of the commons" is avoided through social norms, reputation systems, and corporate sponsorship.

Linux succeeds despite classical game theory predicting free-riding collapse.
