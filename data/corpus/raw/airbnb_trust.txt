Airbnb: Strangers stay in strangers' homes.

Host risks: Guest damages property, refuses to leave, throws parties.
Guest risks: Listing is fake, unsafe, or misrepresented.

Both must trust simultaneously - neither moves "first" in a clean sequential sense.

Airbnb solutions:
- Verified identity for both sides
- Reviews from both parties after stay
- Insurance/guarantee programs
- Secure payment (guest pays Airbnb, host paid after check-in)

Holding payment in escrow converts simultaneous trust problem into sequential game with intermediary.

Platform acts as trusted third party, enabling transactions that wouldn't happen in a bilateral setting.
