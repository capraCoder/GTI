A large retail chain is deciding whether to enter a small town market currently dominated by a local store.

If the retailer enters, the local store can either accommodate (accept reduced market share, both make modest profits) or fight (start a price war that hurts both businesses severely).

If the retailer stays out, the local store keeps its monopoly and high profits, while the retailer makes nothing in this market.

The retailer announces its decision first, then the local store responds.
