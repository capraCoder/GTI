Two drivers are speeding toward each other on a narrow road. Each driver can either swerve to avoid collision or keep driving straight.

If both swerve, they both survive but feel slightly embarrassed - a moderate outcome for both.

If one swerves and the other doesn't, the one who swerved is called a "chicken" and loses face, while the one who stayed straight gains respect and status.

If neither swerves, they crash head-on and both suffer catastrophic consequences - the worst possible outcome for everyone.

They must decide simultaneously as they approach each other.
