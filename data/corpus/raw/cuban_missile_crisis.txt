October 1962: Soviet missiles discovered in Cuba. Kennedy must respond.

USA options: Naval blockade (moderate) or Air strike (aggressive)
USSR options: Withdraw missiles (back down) or Hold firm (escalate)

If both hold firm (USA strikes, USSR retaliates): Nuclear war - catastrophic for both.
If USA backs down, USSR keeps missiles: USA loses face, strategic disadvantage.
If USSR backs down, USA blockades: USSR loses face but avoids war.
If both back down simultaneously: Face-saving compromise possible.

Neither wants nuclear war, but neither wants to appear weak. Classic chicken with existential stakes.

Both sides communicated through back-channels, looking for a way to let the other back down gracefully.
