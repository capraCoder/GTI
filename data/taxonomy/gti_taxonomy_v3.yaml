  Prisoners_Dilemma:
    aliases: ["PD", "Dilemma"]
    rg_ordering: "c > a > d > b"
    description: |
      Classic social dilemma where individual rationality leads to collective 
      suboptimality. Both players have dominant strategies to defect, but 
      mutual cooperation would yield higher payoffs.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: true
      nash_equilibrium: ["Defect-Defect"]
      pareto_optimal: false  # Nash is not Pareto optimal
      cooperation_tension: high
    canonical_payoffs: [3, 0, 5, 1]  # R, S, T, P format: [CC, CD, DC, DD]
    examples:
      - "Arms race"
      - "Environmental pollution"
      - "Price wars"
      - "Common pool resource extraction"

  Chicken:
    aliases: ["Hawk-Dove", "Snowdrift", "Game of Chicken"]
    rg_ordering: "c > a > b > d"
    description: |
      Anti-coordination game where mutual aggression is worst outcome.
      Each player prefers the other to yield, but yielding alone beats
      mutual destruction.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: false
      nash_equilibrium: ["Hawk-Dove", "Dove-Hawk"]  # Two asymmetric NE
      mixed_equilibrium: true
      brinkmanship: high
    canonical_payoffs: [0, -1, 1, -10]
    examples:
      - "Nuclear standoff"
      - "Lane merging"
      - "Territorial disputes"

  Stag_Hunt:
    aliases: ["Trust", "Assurance", "Coordination"]
    rg_ordering: "a > c > d > b"
    description: |
      Coordination game with payoff-dominant and risk-dominant equilibria.
      Mutual cooperation yields highest payoffs but is risky; safe defection
      gives moderate but certain outcome.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: false
      nash_equilibrium: ["Cooperate-Cooperate", "Defect-Defect"]
      payoff_dominant: "Cooperate-Cooperate"
      risk_dominant: "Defect-Defect"
    canonical_payoffs: [4, 0, 3, 2]
    examples:

      - "Currency adoption"
      - "Social conventions"

  Battle_of_the_Sexes:
    aliases: ["BoS", "Leader", "Coordination with conflict"]
    rg_ordering: "c > b > a > d"
    description: |
      Coordination game where players prefer different equilibria.
      Both prefer coordination over miscoordination, but disagree on
      which equilibrium is better.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: false
      nash_equilibrium: ["A-A", "B-B"]
      conflict_of_interest: true
      coordination_needed: true

      - "Technology standards"
      - "Meeting location"

  Deadlock:
    aliases: ["Altruist's Dilemma", "No-conflict"]
    rg_ordering: "c > d > a > b"
    description: |
      Game where defection dominates but mutual defection is not as bad
      as in Prisoner's Dilemma. Less tension between individual and
      collective rationality.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: true
      nash_equilibrium: ["Defect-Defect"]
      pareto_optimal: true  # Unlike PD, Nash IS Pareto optimal

      Success requires mutual trust in coordination.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: false
      nash_equilibrium: ["A-A", "B-B"]
      pure_coordination: true
    canonical_payoffs: [4, 1, 2, 3]

      Coordination game with safe fallback option. Players can coordinate
      on either option, with one being slightly better.

  Hero:
    aliases: ["Hero Game"]
    rg_ordering: "c > b > d > a"
    description: |
      Game where one player sacrifices for mutual benefit. Being the
      hero (choosing B while other chooses A) is better than mutual A.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: false

    description: |
      Game where mutual compromise (B,B) is preferred by row player
      over mutual first choice (A,A).
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: false
      compromise_preferred: true
    canonical_payoffs: [0, 1, 3, 2]

  Peace:
    aliases: ["Club", "Peace Game"]
    rg_ordering: "a > b > d > c"
    description: |
      Game where cooperation dominates but defection alone is not
      catastrophic. Peaceful coexistence is naturally stable.
    properties:
      dominant_strategy: true
      nash_equilibrium: ["A-A"]
      stable_peace: true
    canonical_payoffs: [4, 3, 1, 2]
